# Vimrc

### Description

This is my .vimrc file. Which means this is the configuration file for Vim I use. Which means I use Vim as my main editor, even though I'm a complete noob with it.

### Installation

You'll need Vim. It's basically everywhere. If you use a Linux distro, you probably already have it. If not, you can get it [here](http://www.vim.org/download.php).
If you run
```sh
$ make setup
```
the Makefile will echo into your vimrc to source the vimrc in this project. As this project was made (1) for me to clone it everywhere I code and to maintain a single .vimrc and (2) for beginners, I expect your .vimrc file to be empty/non-existant. I have NOT tested the Makefile as a form to integrate this project with another .vimrc. Which means it is not pluggable (yet).

### Stuff to keep in mind

I'm a noob with Vim. Everything in this .vimrc was added as I felt that something was missing, which is why I feel this is a great .vimrc for beginners. I use [junegunn's vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) a plugin manager
