# Vimrc

### Description

This is my .vimrc file. 

Which means this is the configuration file for Vim I use. 

Which means I use Vim as my main editor, even though I'm a complete noob with it.

### Installation

You'll need Vim. It's basically everywhere. If you use a Linux distro, you probably already have it. 

If not, you can get it [here](http://www.vim.org/download.php).

To copy my .vimrc into yours and its dependencies on your .vim folder, run the command bellow.

WARNING: This command will replace your .vimrc with mine, and your .vim folder with my stuff, run it a your own risk. If you already have a configured .vimrc/.vim folder, DO NOT run this.
```sh
$ make setup
```
After that, run `:PlugInstall` from inside your newly made .vimrc, and you'll be good to go.

This repo was made for mainly two reasons:
1. For me to clone everywhere I code, and maintain a single .vimrc file
2. For beginners
So, for the moment, I will not make it as pluggable as it could be. Any hints would be really appreciated and integrated (given you made a PR ;) )


### Stuff to keep in mind

1.I'm a noob with Vim. 
2.Everything in this .vimrc was added as I felt that something was missing, which is why I feel this is a great .vimrc for beginners. 
3.I use [junegunn's vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as plugin manager
4.I'm currently working as a full time developer, as I go for my Information Systems degree. Which means you should NOT wait for daily/weekly updates.
